# UFOs

Purpose of the project

  Dana wants to share her knowledge about UFO via html, she wants to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. She also creates filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 
  We will use webpage using Bootstrap, and equip our table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.

 1.	Overview of the analysis:
      o	Using javascript, we were able to define filters and create search button for items such as country, state, date, and so on. The user is able to input the data and search for more information about the existing data for UFO sightings. 
      
2.	Results:
      o	On the created html website, there is an empty box to enter requested data so that the user can find the specific results and find the recorded data they are looking for.

3.	Summary:
    o	This webpage has typos and uses a lot of abbreviation for the data, maybe it is a good idea to clean the data before putting it on the web.
    o	My Recommendation would be to have a link to the possible images for the data available on site, so when a user is looking for a data in specific location or country, they can have the link to go and see more evidence about the catch.
