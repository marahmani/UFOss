# UFOs

Purpose of the project

Dana wants to share her knowledge about UFO via html, she wants to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. She also creates filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. We will use webpage using Bootstrap, and equip our table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.
